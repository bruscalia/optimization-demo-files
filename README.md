This is a repository with examples and tutorials on numerical optimization.

Check my [Medium profile](https://medium.com/@bruscalia12) for some interesting articles about these examples.

## Convex
Here you will find:

- Implementation from scratch of usual gradient-based line search algorithms in Python.
- Solution of a constrained problem using the scipy.optimize minimize function.
- Optimization of a chemical reactor problem.

## Nonconvex
Here you will find:

- Implementation Differential Evolution using scipy.optimize.
- Solutions of convex, nondifferentiable, and nonconvex problems using DE and classic algorithms.
